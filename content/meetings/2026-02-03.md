## Client Project Breakdown Notes: 02/03

## First Deliverable - 
- 1-2 page whitepaper on the pros and cons of different model providers
    - Look at the availability of stock on top of the LLM (like vertex) that stands between the LLM and the application
    - Contact the orgs and figure out what they cost (looking at the eudcational context of 501(c)(3) and sorts of plans available)
    - What is feasible with those models and middleware?

## Project Overview:
Decision: Taking last year's project and improving it, building a better, more stable version on an industrial stack/basis.
- He wants an AI system added to be an exploritory tool for the website and as a document manager
- Project is deployed on an "ISP" and manages files through Filezilla. Would prefer commercial-grade industrial-type middleware
- The rag system should be able to talk about the entire website. Any information on the website should be a part of the DMS. 
    - **minus the foundation information, this is not meant to be public but he does not have another site for it**
- Each page should have an agent button in the toolbar that allows you to ask questions about the current page and use it for context.

#### Document Management System
- He wants a documenet management system: to manage and convert documents to go from things like HTML website to a form that can be processed bt the stack/middleware
- Include conversation history, possibly tagging conversations and storing them

#### AI Usage
- Client emphasised using AI to plan/write code and potentially keeping track of conversation history while developing
