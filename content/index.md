## A Node/Network Document System with Web Access and Automatic Incremental Update of an Available LLM System

### Client
**Name:** John B. Smith (UNC Computer Science, emmeritus)  
**Contact:** jbs@cs.unc.edu  

### Summary
- **Quick Summary:** Adding agentic behavior and AI chatbot via Gemini to a data site for a nature preserve.  
- [Project Specs](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~stotts/COMP523-s26/vids/jbs-2.pdf)  
#### Details
This project will work with an extensive Web site that includes information on an existing ecologically significant conservation reserve ([chicorylane.com](http://chicorylane.com/)) and maps it into a dynamic document system to be developed by the project. The doc systerm is a node/network based structure, having nodes that may contain pages of mixed media content that can be accessed through a conventional Web browser.

Nodes will be recursive, in the sense of nodes containing other node structures as content. Innovations will also include an automatic feature to feed data incrementally into some to-be-identified existing LLM system as well as explore techniques for incorporating relational database information (ecological attributes concerning plants in the reserve) into the LLM.

Earlier work on several similar data models are available.
