## Overview

> [!info]- Quick Summary
> Adding agentic behavior and AI chatbot via Gemini to a data site for a nature preserve.  

We are working with the [ChicoryLane conservation reserve](http://chicorylane.com/)'s website and its data, to map the content into a dynamic document system. 

The system is a node/graph based structure, with nodes that may contain pages of mixed media content accessible through a web browser. Nodes will be recursive, containing other node structures as content. 

The goal is to extend the previous work, which implemented a **RAG-based chatbot**, and extending it to an **AI platform with agentic capabilities**.

Planned innovations include:
- An automatic feature to incrementally feed data into the existing LLM system
- Exploring techniques for incorporating relational database information (like ecological attributes concerning plants in the reserve) into the knowledge base
- Architectural and cost-based evaluation of development options for a mainstream vertical integration stack
